# ðŸ›’ Superstore Sales Analysis Project

Tech stack used: PySpark,SQL,Databricks

### What I did in this project:

I used PySpark to:

Read the Superstore dataset and check its schema and data types

Calculate total sales and profit by category to identify which categories bring the highest revenue

Find the state with the highest number of orders to see where the business is performing well

Calculate average discount by sub-category to evaluate discount strategies

Identify the top 5 customers by profit for customer retention strategies

Count the number of loss-making orders to reduce unprofitable sales

Check the correlation between sales and profit to understand profitability better

I used SQL to:

Calculate overall total sales and profit

Find sales by region to compare performance geographically

Identify the most profitable category

List top 5 products by sales

Calculate average discount by category

Count orders per ship mode

Calculate profit margin per category

Analyse repeat customers

### This project helps in understanding:

Which categories and products generate the most revenue and profit

Which customers and states are most valuable for the business

How discounts affect profit margins

Delivery efficiency through delivery time calculations
